NOTE:

The costs reported in these files are wrong!!

They all need to be multiplied by the constant factor of 4/pi

This improper scaling has been fixed with a script titled DubinsNov15DataFix.m and stored in new data files labeled:

DubinsTestData-229Milestone-ConstHeading-Nov15-1-FIXED.txt
DubinsTestData-229Milestone-UnconstHeading-Nov15-1-FIXED.txt
DubinsTrainData-229Milestone-ConstHeading-Nov15-1-FIXED.txt
DubinsTrainData-229Milestone-UnconstHeading-Nov15-1-FIXED.txt

For posterity, the unfixed files have not been deleted
